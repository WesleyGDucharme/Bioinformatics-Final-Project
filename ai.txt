LLM model used: ChatGPT 
Version: GPT-5

This ai.txt will be very similar to prior descriptions, as I used it in pretty much the same way as my other deliverables in Csc427.

Use case:
Throughout my work on the final project I used ChatGPT to:
- Used it to help develop the scripts that run the experiments, using to draft skeleton outlines for the scripts and help me with coding implementation.
- Used it help debug and plan how to run each script for each experiment.
- Had it help me develop the source package and aid in debugging.
- Had it draft some small tests to run the source package before committing to model training time.
- Use of the LLM was limited solely towards code and method implementation within this repository.

Notes:
- I edited and ran all code locally to verify correctness.
- AI suggestions were adapted and integrated into my own implementation unless a version the ai suggested worked really well the first time.
- Not all outputs from ChatGPT were used directly — in some cases I rolled back to earlier versions or of course ignored the answers and solution prototypes that I knew were wrong or would not work.

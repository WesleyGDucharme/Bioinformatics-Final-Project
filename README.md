# Bioinformatics-Final-Project
Final project for CSC427 at Uvic. For this project we are to find a bioinformatics paper and recreate / reimplement their code and experiments to then compare our results with the original authors. This is done to get experience testing the reproducability of experiments and performing said experiments oursleves.
